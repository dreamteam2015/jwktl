/**
 * A generic iterator that is used for Wiktionary data objects (i.e.,
 * {@link IWiktionaryPage}, {@link IWiktionaryEntry}, 
 * {@link IWiktionarySense}). The iterator supports both the usage as 
 * {@link Iterator} and as {@link Iterable}.
 * <p>
 * Caveat: the latter provides always the same instance, so use the
 * WiktionaryIterator as an {@link Iterable} only once or fetch another
 * WiktionaryIterator for other uses. This should save some memory <i>and</i>
 * allow convenient usage in numerous situations. Besides, the implementation 
 * also allows to react on stopping the iteration, which is the case if
 * (a) all items have been traversed, or (b) the user manually stops the
 * iteration by invoking the {@link #close()} method. Implementing the 
 * corresponding hotspot offers the possibility of closing a connection
 * or freeing a resource after iteration. The iterator is read-only.
 * @param <IterableType> the object type that is the subject of iteration.
